# Ensemble
Ensemble is a project management software for companies and the like to assign tasks, manage deadlines
and solve conflicts. Ensemble allows you to view timelines, mark tasks and projects as complete, record
data, and predict project returns. Ensemble provides enhanced data customization and storage, using
"Components" and templates to personalize how your information is recorded. With "Issues", you can
post and communicate with team members about events. Using all we have learned, Ensemble represents 
our experience in and dedication to computer science.

This is a repository that contains all source code and project planning files that were used to create
our desktop application Ensemble.
